flewkey-overlay

A personal Gentoo overlay for flewkey, with miscellaneous packages.

Use the folling command to add it with layman:
layman -a flewkey-overlay

Please contact me if there are any issues with these ebuilds. I would be glad
to provide support and correct any problems they may have.

Audio-related ebuilds may be removed if they are added to the audio-overlay. I
recommend adding their overlay, since it is well maintained and held to proper
quality standards.

Send questions, issues, and patches to flewkey@2a03.party.
